Scalability of big data visualization has been the subject of various proposed solutions.
The majority of these solutions focus on data reduction~\cite{Liu2013}, precomputation~\cite{Liu2013}, occlusion removal, and parallel computation~\cite{Liu2013}.
We propose a new optimization which uses indexed lineage annotations to reduce the number of queries required for certain interactions.
In order to accomodate these types of interactions, a new way of describing interactions is necessary.
This new way of describing interactions is declarative, like Vega~\cite{Satyanarayan}.
It differs from Vega, however, in that it focuses on the relationship between visualizations and tables.
