abstract = {Data analysts must make sense of increasingly large data sets, sometimes with billions or more records.We present methods for interactive visualization of big data, following the principle that perceptual and interactive scalability should be limited by the chosen resolution of the visualized data, not the number of records. We first describe a design space of scalable visual summaries that use data reduction methods (such as binned aggregation or sampling) to visualize a variety of data types. We then contribute methods for interactive querying (e.g., brushing {\&}linking) among binned plots through a combination of multivariate data tiles and parallel query processing.We implement our techniques in imMens, a browser-based visual analysis system that usesWebGL for data processing and rendering on the GPU. In benchmarks imMens sustains 50 frames-per-second brushing {\&} linking among dozens of visualizations, with invariant performance on data sizes ranging from thousands to billions of records.},

abstract = {We present Reactive Vega, a system architecture that provides the first robust and comprehensive treatment of declarative visual and interaction design for data visualization. Starting from a single declarative specification, Reactive Vega constructs a dataflow graph in which input data, scene graph elements, and interaction events are all treated as first-class streaming data sources. To support expressive interactive visualizations that may involve time-varying scalar, relational, or hierarchical data, Reactive Vegaâ€™s dataflow graph can dynamically re-write itself at runtime by extending or pruning branches in a data-driven fashion. We discuss both compile- and run-time optimizations applied within Reactive Vega, and share the results of benchmark studies that indicate superior interactive performance to both D3 and the original, non-reactive Vega system.},
